Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) under the Ministry of Rural Development was conceptualized and launched on 25th December, 2000 as a centrally sponsored scheme, with the broad objective of sustainable poverty reduction in rural areas. The main objective of PMGSY is to provide basic access by way of single all-weather road to all eligible unconnected habitations in the Core Network. Under PMGSY, approx. 6,26,034 km of length has been constructed till 31st March 2020. It is a challenge to manage such a gigantic activity using traditional methods, which is not only tedious and time-consuming but also difficult to ensure timely retrieval of the desired information.

The use of Geo Informatics is taken up to help in effective planning, decision making and monitoring of PMGSY roads. The Tripartite Agreement on Use of Geo Informatics in Rural Road Projects under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was made and executed at New Delhi on 7th March, 2017 between National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and Center for Geo-Informatics Application in Rural Development (CGARD). Under this project National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) has jointly taken up to produce geospatial datasets for the country. This project is to extract and identify roads connectivity status in terms of length based on inputs provided by NRIDA.This includes generating a spatial database on road connectivity with respect to habitations connected under completed roads. Hence, it is essential to generate a rural road map based on satellite imagery for the roads sanctioned from the year 2000-01 onwards for further investigation and analysis.

Baseline Studies on Water Use Efficiency (WUE) of Irrigation projects: The performance of the existing irrigation systems (particularly, the Major and Medium irrigation projects) suffer from low water use efficiency, distribution losses, poor operational maintenance and management of soil salinity, water logging and tail end problems. Space-borne multi-spectral data by virtue of synoptic coverage of a fairly large area at regular interval has been found to be very useful in generating information on the status of irrigation commands for objective evaluation and for taking up corrective measures. NRSC carried out performance evaluation of command areas using satellite remote sensing data across several irrigation projects in India. Baseline study of water use efficiency of 10 medium irrigation projects in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh States is conducted by NRSC in collaboration with WALAMTARI with the objectives to assess the irrigated area and irrigation system performance for the projects under consideration for the year 2016- 2017 with satellite inputs coupled with infield measurements. The portal depicts the various elements of the 10 medium irrigation projects under investigation. The various geo-spatial data sets cover administrative, infrastructure, topographic/terrain, thematic, hydrological, irrigation and socio-economic aspects. The portal hosts ground truth data collected by field functionaries. The portal also enables periodic updation of dynamic field data on irrigation canal supplies and reservoir storage.

About 'Lost River Saraswati' - The 'Lost Saraswati River' in NW India is the holiest and mightiest river of the Vedic Period (8000-5000 BP). The discovery of the sites of Harappan civilization along the banks of the Saraswati River indicates towards its mighty and magnanimity. Vedic Saraswati River originated in the Himalayas and flowed between Indus River in the west and Ganges River in the east through Punjab, Haryana, western Rajasthan and Gujarat. It is finally drained into Gulf of Kachchh in Arabian Sea. The Vedic Saraswati River disappeared around 5000 BP due to climatic and tectonic changes. It is believed that River Saraswati is still flowing below the Thar desert and its Himalayan connectivity is alive. The relict of this lost river is preserved as palaeochannels under the cover of aeolian sand / alluvium. Visit portal: https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/saraswati/saraswati.php

Saraswati River in Ancient Literatures - The name `Saraswati' has been used in most of the ancient literatures like Vedas, Manusmriti, Mahabharata and Puranas: 1. Vedas - There are frequent references of River Saraswati in Vedic literature (80 times more than that of River Ganges). No other river has received so much importance and respect as Saraswati. The Vedic hymns are composed by different Rishis (scholars) in the glory of River Saraswati. (a) Rigveda - Vedic Saraswati is described as `Best of Mothers, Best of Rivers, Best of Goddesses`. (b) Yajurveda - Saraswati has five important tributaries viz. Drishadvati, Satudri (Sutlej), Chandrabagha (Chenab), Vipasa (Vyas) and Iravati (Ravi). All these rivers merge to Saraswati to meet Sindhu Sagar (the Arabian Sea). (c) Atharvaveda - God bestowed the people on the bank of the Saraswati, with sweet juicy barley, where generous Maruts became farmers & Indra as the Lord of agriculture. This Mantra suggests that farming of cereals was practiced on the fertile soil of Saraswati during Vedic times. 2. Manusmriti - The land between the Saraswati and Drishadvati is created by God; this land is defined as Brahmavarta. 3. Mahabharata - Mahabharata gives clear geographical accounts of a number of pilgrimage sites spread along the course of the Saraswati River. Lord Balaram after visiting a number of holy places reaches to Vinasana, the place where the Saraswati disappeared. During Mahabharata period, the discharge of water in Saraswati became extremely low. As a result, the river vanished in the desert sand at certain place along its regular course i.e. at Vinasana. Hence, the river channel appeared dry. 4. Purana - Rishi Markandeya, close to the place where he meditated and offered sacrifices saw Saraswati rising from the Plaksha tree (Pipal tree). The sage prayed and worshiped the rising river.

Discovering `Lost River Saraswati' through Remote Sensing Techniques - Discovering the exact course of Vedic Saraswati River and its perennial source is a challenging task among the researchers due to lack of proper scientific database. The mystery is unravelled through modern tools like Remote Sensing and GIS by using multi-spectral and multi-resolution satellite images of optical and microwave data. ISRO centres could able to delineate most of the palaeochannels of Vedic Saraswati River and its linkage with the present day Himalayan Rivers.

Linkages of Vedic Saraswati with Himalayan Rivers - (a) Linkage of Saraswati Nadi with Somb River at Adi Badri (b) Linkage of Saraswati Nadi with Yamuna River (c) Linkage of Saraswati Nadi with Vedic Saraswati (d) Linkage of Sutlej Palaeochannel with Vedic Saraswati (e) Linkage of Vedic Saraswati from Mannsarovar to Dwaraka

Utility of Palaeochannel Maps - 1. Cultural Heritage: (a) Restoration of Historical sites and (b) Excavation of New Archaeological Sites. 2. Ground Water: (a) Groundwater exploration and (b) Groundwater recharge 3. Tourism Sector: (a) Renovation of temples and (b) Reconstruction of Ritual Sites along the bank of Saraswati River
